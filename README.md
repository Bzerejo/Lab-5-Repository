When licensing, our company was worried about being taken advantage of by big tech companies who would effectively offload their work to us and use our code to power their services. We have bargaining power with them, and needed to leverage it to expand our resources and continue providing innovative tech solutions to the world. Therefore, our license comes off a little harsh.
When researching code of conduct, we took a segment of Google's code valuing trust and usefulness of our products foremost. We want to make sure customers know that our products are safe and we want our software to be as useful as it can.
